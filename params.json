Also you can use mixed approach (keep some options in file, others enter from command line). For example if you do not want to keep password in configuration file, just don't, you will be asked.\r\n\r\nAlso you can use it directly in ruby code:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'jira_report'\r\n\r\ndef print_issues(issues)\r\n  issues.each do |issue|\r\n    puts \"  #{issue['key']} - #{issue['fields']['summary']}\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nreporter = JiraReport::Reporter.new('jira.company.com', 'admin', 's3cr3t')\r\n# returns all created issues by 'my_jira_name'\r\nall_created = reporter.created('my_jira_name')\r\n\r\n# returns closed issues by 'admin' last week\r\nweekly_closed = reporter.closed('admin', '-1w')\r\n\r\n# returns reopened issues by 'usr' in period starting\r\n# from two weeks ago and ending one week ago.\r\nreopened = reporter.reopened('usr', '-2w', '-1w')\r\n\r\nprint_issues(weekly_closed)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\nPath to configuration file can be specified by `-c` command line argument. `~/.jira-report` is default.\r\n\r\nThere are three main options in config file to query jira:\r\n\r\n```\r\nurl=jira.company.com\r\nusername=username\r\npassword=s3cr3t\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may pass all those options (or some of them) in command line mode.\r\n\r\nPeriod is set by two options `period_from` and `period_till`. Both options support [advanced jira searching](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Advanced+Searching) and accept dates, jira functions, aliasing. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nperiod_from=-1w\r\nperiod_till=now()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf those options not specified in configuration file, last week activities will be queried (just as in example above).\r\n\r\nYou can look at configuration file [sample](example/jira-report.sample) in repository.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
